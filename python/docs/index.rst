Welcome to dlisio's documentation!
==================================

For help, examples and reference, type ``help(function)`` in
your favourite python interpreter, or ``pydoc function`` in the unix console.

Before you get started we recommended that you familiarize yourself with some
basic concepts of the dlis file format. Remember, dlis is a non-trivial format
to work with.  Even though dlisio aims to be simple-to-use library that
abstracts away some of the pain of dlis, there are some concepts from the
standard you need to be familiar with to be able to work with these files.
Check out this short overview of need-to-know-concepts: :ref:`Digital Log Interchange
Standard (DLIS)`.
