LIS Structures
--------------

Other structures defined by LIS79

.. class:: dlisio.core.spec_block_0()

    Spec Block - Subtype 0

    A Spec Block contains information needed to correctly parse one channel from
    a frame. It also contains useful information such as the units of the curve
    measurement.

    .. note::
        For those familiar with DLIS, Spec Blocks are analogous to DLIS
        Channels :class:`dlisio.dlis.Channel`.

    .. attribute:: mnemonic

        Name of the channel

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: service_id

        The service ID identifies the tool, the tool string used to measure the
        datum, or the name of the computed product.

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: service_order_nr

        A unique number which identifies the logging trip to the well-site.

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: units

        Units of the channel

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: file_nb

        Indicates the file number at the time the data was first acquired and
        written (for well-site data acquisitions only). This number, together
        with service_id and service_order_nr will uniquely identify any data
        string for the purpose of merging or other processing.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: reserved_size

        The number of bytes reserved for this channel in the frame. If size is
        negative, the output is suppressed. The space is still reserved, and is
        the absolute value of this entry.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: samples

        The number of samples recorded per frame. When samples == 1, the
        channel is sampled at the same interval as the index of the frame.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: reprc

        The type of the recorded channel data. This number refers to one of the
        LIS79-defined data types.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: api_log_type

        This, together with the attributes :attr:`api_curve_type`,
        :attr:`api_curve_class` and :attr:`api_modifier` form a largly outdated
        log/curve code system utilizing a 2 digit curve code. Ref API Bulletin
        D-9 Feb '79.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: api_curve_type

        See :attr:`api_log_type`.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: api_curve_class

        See :attr:`api_log_type`.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: api_modifier

        See :attr:`api_log_type`.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: process_level

        Process level is a measure of the amount of processing done to obtain
        the curve. The size of the number increases in proportion to the amount
        of processing. However, the system has never been objectively defined.

        :type: int

.. class:: dlisio.core.spec_block_1()

    Spec Block - Subtype 1

    Spec Blocks subtype 1 share most of its attributes with
    :class:`dlisio.core.spec_block_0`. However, there are 3 notable differences:

    - The ``api_*``-attributes are replaced with :attr:`api_codes`
    - Subtype 1 has no ``process_level``
    - Subtype 1 defines :attr:`process_indicators`, which do not exist in subtype 0.

    .. attribute:: mnemonic
    .. attribute:: service_id
    .. attribute:: service_order_nr
    .. attribute:: units
    .. attribute:: file_nb
    .. attribute:: reserved_size
    .. attribute:: samples
    .. attribute:: reprc
    .. attribute:: api_codes

        API codes form a log/curve system featuring a 3-digit curve code (Ref:
        API Bulletin D-9 Jul '79). The API codes are represented as a 32 bit
        integer. The 8-digit number can be masked out to dd/ddd/dd/d. E.g
        ``45310011`` should be interpreted as::

        - Log Type    = 45
        - Curve Type  = 310
        - Curve Class = 01
        - Modifier    = 1

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: process_indicators

        Process Indicators are used to define different processes or
        corrections that have been performed on the channel. The process
        indicators are defined as a bit-mask of 40 bits:

        ======= ===========================================
        Bit nr  Definition
        ======= ===========================================
        0-1     original logging direction [1]
        2       true vertical depth correction
        3       data channel not on depth
        4       data channel is filtered
        5       data channel is calibrated
        6       computed (processed thru a function former)
        7       derived (computed from more than one tool)
        8       tool defined correction nb 2
        9       tool defined correction nb 1
        10      mudcake correction
        11      lithology correction
        12      inclinometry correction
        13      pressure correction
        14      hole size correction
        15      temperature correction
        22      auxiliary data flag
        23      schlumberger proprietary
        ======= ===========================================

        A value of 1 for a specific bit means that the correction or process is
        applied. Note that bits not listed in the table are undefined /
        unassigned  by LIS79.

        [1] Bits 0 and 1 form a single entry that defines the original logging
        direction for this channel. A value of '01' (1) indicates down-hole.
        '10' (2) indicated up-hole, while '00' (0) indicates an ambiguous
        direction. I.e.  stationary. '11' (3) is undefined.

        For convenience the bitmask is expanded to an object with all the above
        definitions as attributes.
