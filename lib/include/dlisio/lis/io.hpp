/** LIS aware IO device
 *
 * iodevice provides an interface for indexing and reading logical records (LR)
 * from a raw LIS file.
 *
 * On disk, a LIS file is essentially organized as a
 * sequence of Physical Records (LR):
 *
 *                PR1               PR2               PR3
 *     |                     |               |                     |
 *      -----------------------------------------------------------
 *     | PRH | LRH | LR data | PRH | LR data | PRH | LRH | LR data |
 *      -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In short, a PR is a mechanics for segmenting LRs into smaller chunks. LR's
 * _always_ start at the begining of a new PR, and may span multiple. Whether
 * or not a LR spans multiple LR's is described by the succesor/predeccesor
 * attributes in the PR headers:
 *
 *           predeccesor     successor   LRn     contains LRH
 *           ------------------------------------------------
 *      PR1      0               1       0           yes
 *      PR2      1               0       0           no
 *      PR3      0               0       1           yes
 *           ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This means that the 3 PR's from the first illustration encapsulate 2 LRs.
 * The first LR spans PR1-PR2, and the second LR is contained entirely in PR3.
 * Note that the LR header is *not* repeated in each PR when the LR spans
 * multiple PRs.
