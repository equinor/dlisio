 * Query how many bytes to trim off the end of a record segment

 * Parse and pack arbitrary data
 *
 * The dlis_packf (inspired by sscanf) reads arbitrary bytes in RP66 format,
 * and pack them into the dst area as native C data. No padding bytes are
 * inserted, which means the data can be read from this array by computing the
 * correct offset and memcpy'd into a typed variable.
 *
 * fmt is a sscanf-inspired format string of conversion specifiers
 * (DLIS_FMT_*). The size of each type depends on the most natural
 * corresponding C type, e.g. SSHORT is int8_t, and UNORM is uint16_t. The
 * arguments to a dlis_type() function in dlisio/types.h is the type being used
 * as a target type for a conversion specifier.
 *
 * String types are always written as int32_t + len bytes, without a zero
 * terminator.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Extracting a frame with three channels:
 * C1 -> 1x1 unorm   (i16)
 * C2 -> 2x1 fsingle (f32)
 * C3 -> 1x1 uvari   (yields i32)
 *
 * int16_t C1;
 * float C2[2];
 * int32_t C3;
 *
 * unsigned char bytes[2 + 2*4 + 4];
 * err = dlis_packf("Uffi", src, bytes);
 * if (err) exit(1);
 *
 * memcpy(&C1, bytes,      sizeof(C1));
 * memcpy(C2,  bytes + 2,  sizeof(C2));
 * memcpy(&c3, bytes + 10, sizeof(C3));

 * Check if a format string for packing is var-size or fixed-size
 *
 * This function is intended for checking if format strings built from
 * inspecting records is fixed-sized or not, which in turn can guide if it's
 * possible to random-access onto variables. The output variables are booleans
 * - the src output is true if the format is variable-size on disk, and the dst
 * output is true if the format is variable-size *in memory*. This is
 * determined by the presence of UVARI and ORIGIN which are variable-sized on
 * disk, but fixed-size in memory.
 *
 * This functionality can be implemented by manually checking if the format
 * string contains any of "sSoOAQ", but is provided for convenience.
 *
 * Returns DLIS_OK on success, and DLIS_INVALID_ARGS if the format strings
 * contain any invalid format specifier. The output params are non-zero if
 * there are any variable-length values in the format specifier, and 0 if all
 * types are fixed-length. If the function fails, the output variable is
 * untouched.
 *
 * To compute the length of a fixed-size string, use dlis_pack_size. src is the
 * size of the pack on disk, and dst the length of the packed string in memory,
 * i.e.  UVARI is 4 bytes, not inconsistent. For individual object sizes, refer
 * to the DLIS_SIZEOF constants in dlisio/types.h
 *
 * NOTE:
 * dlis_pack_size considers the src variable-size when fmt has UVARI, but the
 * dst fixed-size. This will return DLIS_OK, but set src to
 * DLIS_VARIABLE_LENGTH (= 0).
 *
 * For both functions, both src and dst can be NULL, in which case no data will
 * be written.

/*
 * Find offsets of logical records
 *
 * Finding the offsets where logical segments start is not quite straight
 * forward, because logical records aren't required to align with visible
 * record envelopes. Additionally, there's no requirement that visible records
 * nor logical records are of equal length. Furthermore, there are files out
 * there with millions of logical records.
 *
 * This function finds the start of logical records [1], and outputs:
 * 1. the (negative) distance from end to record
 * 2. the bytes *remaining* in this visible record
 * 3. if this record is explicitly formatted or not
 *
 * Because it's unknown how many records there are in a file (or even a section
 * of a file), pre-allocation of output arrays is impractical. Instead, it is
 * designed to be "resumable" - when allocated output arrays are exhausted, the
 * function returns (with DLIS_OK), and more space can be allocated (or
 * something else altogether). If invoked again with the same initial_residual,
 * end, and count, and next as the new begin, the effect will be the same as if
 * the larger allocation was given to the original call.
 *
 * It records the (record - end) negative distance, because it makes "fixing"
 * the offsets (i.e. making them 0-offset from start-of-file) easier with
 * multiple invocations. It also allows begin to change, which is more natural
 * than the one-beyond-last. For a reference, see examples.
 *
 * Using begin/end pairs of pointers allows this function to find positions of
 * logical records from the middle of files and sequences, and leaves actual
 * reading from file/disk to the caller. This is particularly useful with
 * memory mapped files, as it would be an efficient code path to quickly
 * indexing a new file.
 *
 * No arrays are compressed, i.e. the tells[0], residuals[0] and explicits[0]
 * all describe the same logical record.
 *
 * Records are read until either:
 * 1. the end-of-file is reached (given by end)
 * 2. allocsize records are read
 *
 * Both are considered success, and return DLIS_OK. If end-of-file is reached
 * => next == end
 *
 * For every recorded record, count is incremented. Count *must* be initialised
 * before calling this function. Count is *not* reset between invocations.
 *
 * Arguments
 * ---------
 * begin: start of memory area
 * end: one-beyond memory area
 * allocsize: upper bound on the number of records read for this invocation.
 *            Should be the same as the size allocated in tells/residuals/explicits.
 * initial_residual: number of still-to-process bytes in the last seen visible envelope.
 *                   If called from the start of the file (past the storage unit
 *                   label) this should be 0. Upon return, this will be the
 *                   remaining bytes of the current VR at the end of the
 *                   previously-read record, i.e. the value needed to resume.
 * next: the first byte past the end. For successive invocations, this points
 *       to the first, un-read record.
 * count: number of processed logical records.
 *        Incremented for every logical record - this is the actual size of output arrays
 * tells: distance (<=0) from end of the file [end param] to the
 *        1) start of logical record OR
 *        2) start of visible envelope if LR alligns with VE boundaries
 * residuals: bytes remaining for processing in the last encountered visible record.
 *            For LR alligning with VE boundaries value is 0 (not VE size)
 * explicits: if record is explicit
 *
 * next and explicits are optional, and can be NULL. However, unless deciding
 * information is sourced elsewhere, it will now be impossible to distinguish
 * some cases
 *
 * When non-ok error codes are returned, all outputs are updated to the last
 * good known value. This allows manual investigation of issues, before the
 * mapping is resumed. When encountering broken files or minor protocol
 * violations, this enables skipping bits and resuming interpretation.
 *
 * Return value
 * ------------
 *  DLIS_OK: when all records in [begin, end) are read, or when reading the
 *           next record would overflow allocsize. To determine which one,
 *           check the value of next. If next == end, all records are read.
 *  DLIS_TRUNCATED: end was reached before full logical record was read
 *  DLIS_INVALID_ARGS: begin is same as end
 *  DLIS_INCONSISTENT: error on reading headers was thrown by internal function
 *  DLIS_UNEXPECTED_VALUE: VR length < 20 bytes or LRS length < 16
 *
 *
 * Examples
 * --------
 *
 * count = 0;
 * initial_residual = 0;
 * begin = file.begin + 80; // start-of-file + SUL
 * while (true) {
 *     err = dlis_record_offset( begin,

 *                               count + tells,
 *                               count + residuals,
 *                               count + explicits );
 *
 *     if (err != DLIS_OK) exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 *     if (next == end) break;
 *
 *     reallocate(allocsize, &tells, &residuals, &explicits);
 *     begin = next;
 * }
 *
 * size_t filesize = file.end - file.begin + 80;
 * for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
 *     tells[i] += filesize;
